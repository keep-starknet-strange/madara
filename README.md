## About

Kaioshin is a ⚡ blazing fast ⚡ Starknet sequencer, based on substrate and written in Rust 🦀.

![](docs/images/kaioshin-demo-fib-cairo-execution-in-pallet.gif)

## Architecture

`Kaioshin` is formed by those components:
- `node`: services for the blockchain node implementation (chain specification, rpc, ...)
- `pallets`: custom FRAME pallets
  - `pallet-cairo`: Cairo execution engine pallet.
  - `pallet-starknet`: Starknet pallet.
- `runtime`: assemble Kaioshin custom logic with the configured pallets.

Here is a high level overview of the current architecture of Starknet sequencer.

![](docs/images/starknet-sequencer-architecture.png)

### Benchmarking

You can run benchmarks to get an idea of the performance of the pallets. To run the benchmarks, follow the steps within the [benchmarking](./benchmarking/README.md) document.

### Pallets

#### `pallet-cairo`

`pallet-cairo` is a pallet that provides a way to execute Cairo programs in a Substrate environment.

#### `pallet-starknet`

`pallet-starknet` is a pallet that provides a way to execute Starknet contracts in a Substrate environment.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with Kaioshin :hammer_and_wrench:

### Using Nix

Install [nix](https://nixos.org/) and optionally [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) and
[lorri](https://github.com/nix-community/lorri) for a fully plug and play experience for setting up
the development environment. To get all the correct dependencies activate direnv `direnv allow` and
lorri `lorri shell`.

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev
```

Log level can be specified with `-l` flag. For example, `-ldebug` will show debug logs.
It can also be specified via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. For example:
```sh
RUSTLOG=runtime=info cargo run --release -- --dev
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/kaioshin -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with non-persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/kaioshin --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/kaioshin purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/kaioshin -ldebug --dev
```

> Development chain means that the state of our chain will be in a tmp folder while the nodes are
> running. Also, **alice** account will be authority and sudo account as declared in the
> [genesis state](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-kaioshin/blob/main/node/src/chain_spec.rs#L49).
> At the same time the following accounts will be pre-funded:
> - Alice
> - Bob
> - Alice//stash
> - Bob//stash

In case of being interested in maintaining the chain' state between runs a base path must be added
so the db can be stored in the provided folder instead of a temporal one. We could use this folder
to store different chain databases, as a different folder will be created per different chain that
is ran. The following commands shows how to use a newly created folder as our db base path.

```bash
// Create a folder to use as the db base path
$ mkdir my-chain-state

// Use of that folder to store the chain state
$ ./target/release/kaioshin --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/

// Check the folder structure created inside the base path after running the chain
$ ls ./my-chain-state
chains
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/
dev
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/dev
db keystore network
```


### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-end

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect it with **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end
to interact with your chain. [Click
here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) connecting the Apps to your
local node template.

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

Build custom chain spec:

```bash
# Build plain chain spec
cargo run --release -- build-spec --chain local > infra/chain-specs/kaioshin-local-testnet-plain.json
# Build final raw chain spec
cargo run --release -- build-spec --chain infra/chain-specs/kaioshin-local-testnet-plain.json --raw > infra/chain-specs/kaioshin-local-testnet.json
```

See more details about [custom chain specs](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/how-to-guides/basics/customize-a-chain-specification/).

Run the local testnet:

```bash
./infra/local-testnet/run.sh
```

## Project Structure

A Substrate project such as this consists of a number of components that are spread across a few
directories.

### Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network.
Substrate-based blockchain nodes expose a number of capabilities:

- Networking: Substrate nodes use the [`libp2p`](https://libp2p.io/) networking stack to allow the
  nodes in the network to communicate with one another.
- Consensus: Blockchains must have a way to come to
  [consensus](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/consensus/) on the state of the
  network. Substrate makes it possible to supply custom consensus engines and also ships with
  several consensus mechanisms that have been built on top of
  [Web3 Foundation research](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html).
- RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with Substrate nodes.

There are several files in the `node` directory - take special note of the following:

- [`chain_spec.rs`](./node/src/chain_spec.rs): A
  [chain specification](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/chain-spec/) is a
  source code file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain specifications
  are useful for development and testing, and critical when architecting the launch of a
  production chain. Take note of the `development_config` and `testnet_genesis` functions, which
  are used to define the genesis state for the local development chain configuration. These
  functions identify some
  [well-known accounts](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/)
  and use them to configure the blockchain's initial state.
- [`service.rs`](./node/src/service.rs): This file defines the node implementation. Take note of
  the libraries that this file imports and the names of the functions it invokes. In particular,
  there are references to consensus-related topics, such as the
  [block finalization and forks](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/consensus/#finalization-and-forks)
  and other [consensus mechanisms](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/consensus/#default-consensus-models)
  such as Aura for block authoring and GRANDPA for finality.

After the node has been [built](#build), refer to the embedded documentation to learn more about the
capabilities and configuration parameters that it exposes:

```shell
./target/release/kaioshin --help
```

### Runtime

In Substrate, the terms
"runtime" and "state transition function"
are analogous - they refer to the core logic of the blockchain that is responsible for validating
blocks and executing the state changes they define. The Substrate project in this repository uses
[FRAME](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/runtime-intro/#frame) to construct a
blockchain runtime. FRAME allows runtime developers to declare domain-specific logic in modules
called "pallets". At the heart of FRAME is a helpful
[macro language](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/frame-macros/) that makes it easy to
create pallets and flexibly compose them to create blockchains that can address
[a variety of needs](https://substrate.io/ecosystem/projects/).

Review the [FRAME runtime implementation](./runtime/src/lib.rs) included in this template and note
the following:

- This file configures several pallets to include in the runtime. Each pallet configuration is
  defined by a code block that begins with `impl $PALLET_NAME::Config for Runtime`.
- The pallets are composed into a single runtime by way of the
  [`construct_runtime!`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/macro.construct_runtime.html)
  macro, which is part of the core
  FRAME Support [system](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/frame-pallets/#system-pallets) library.

### Pallets

The runtime in this project is constructed using many FRAME pallets that ship with the
[core Substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame) and a
template pallet that is [defined in the `pallets`](./pallets/template/src/lib.rs) directory.

A FRAME pallet is compromised of a number of blockchain primitives:

- Storage: FRAME defines a rich set of powerful
  [storage abstractions](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/runtime-storage/) that makes
  it easy to use Substrate's efficient key-value database to manage the evolving state of a
  blockchain.
- Dispatchables: FRAME pallets define special types of functions that can be invoked (dispatched)
  from outside of the runtime in order to update its state.
- Events: Substrate uses [events and errors](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/events-errors/)
  to notify users of important changes in the runtime.
- Errors: When a dispatchable fails, it returns an error.
- Config: The `Config` configuration interface is used to define the types and parameters upon
  which a FRAME pallet depends.

### Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then run the following command to start a single node development chain.

```bash
docker-compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This command will firstly compile your code, and then start a local development network. You can
also replace the default command
(`cargo build --release && ./target/release/kaioshin --dev --ws-external`)
by appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.

```bash
# Run Substrate node without re-compiling
./infra/docker_run.sh ./target/release/kaioshin --dev --ws-external

# Purge the local dev chain
./infra/docker_run.sh ./target/release/kaioshin purge-chain --dev

# Check whether the code is compilable
./infra/docker_run.sh cargo check
```
