## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any vulnerabilities in **Madara**, please don't hesitate to _report them_.

### Reporting Process:

1. Use any of the [private contact addresses](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara#support).
2. Clearly describe the vulnerability.
   
   If you have a fix, feel free to attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will assess the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or provide mitigating steps. Upon resolution, we will contact you to communicate the outcome and give due credit in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is
   released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the
   vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
