# Madara Benchmarking

This is a collection of scripts and tools to benchmark Madara leveraging artillery.

Steps to follow :
- Install the dependencies using `yarn install`
- Make sure you've built the project using `cd .. && cargo build --release`
- Run the benchmark using `yarn test:ci`.
  If it does not work, just run `sh ../scripts/run_node.sh` and in another terminal run `yarn test` where x is the benchmark you want to run.

The following benchmarks are available :
- `yarn test:chain` : Simple stresstest of the chain
- `yarn test:storage` : Deploys and execute cairo programs to benchmark the storage overhead
- `yarn test:execution` : Executes fib500 cairo programs
- `yarn test:transfer` : Executes ERC20 transfers

Or simply run `yarn test` to run default benchmark and display metrics at the end.
