## 1. Introduction

The Sharingan Testnet is a powerful platform for developing and testing StarkWare-based smart contracts. With its robust infrastructure and developer-friendly features, it provides a sandbox environment to experiment, iterate, and refine your decentralized applications (dApps) before deploying them to the mainnet. This comprehensive guide aims to equip developers with the knowledge and tools necessary to successfully deploy their contracts on the Sharingan Testnet using various programming languages and SDKs.

## 2. Pre-requisites

Before diving into the deployment process, you need to ensure that you have the following pre-requisites in place:

### Software and Tools Requirements

- Operating System: [Specify supported OS versions]
- [List any additional software or tools required for development]

### Account Setup

To interact with the Sharingan Testnet, you will need an account. Follow these steps to set up your account:

1. Visit the Sharingan Testnet website [insert link].
2. Click on "Create Account" or "Sign Up" to create a new account.
3. Fill in the required details, including username, password, and email address.
4. Follow the instructions to complete the account creation process.
5. Once your account is created, securely store your account credentials, including the private key and recovery phrases.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

This section provides a step-by-step process for deploying your contracts on the Sharingan Testnet. We will cover the setup of the development environment and the deployment process using different languages and SDKs.

### 3.1 Setting Up the Development Environment

To begin, we need to set up our development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Install [Development Environment Tool] for your operating system by downloading it from the official website [insert link].
2. Follow the installation instructions provided by [Development Environment Tool].
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following command: [example command]
4. [Additional steps for configuring the development environment]

### 3.2 Deploying Contracts on the Sharingan Testnet

In this section, we will cover the deployment process using three different SDKs: starknet-rs, starknet-js, and starknet-py. Choose the section relevant to the programming language and SDK you prefer.

#### 3.2.1 Using starknet-rs

##### Installation and Setup

1. Install the latest version of Rust programming language by following the instructions on the official Rust website [insert link].
2. Install starknet-rs by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   cargo install starknet_cli
   ```
3. Verify the installation by running:
   ```
   starknet --version
   ```

##### Writing Contracts

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. Write your smart contract code using the StarkNet programming language (Cairo) in a file named `contract.cairo`.

```cairo
[Example contract code]
```

##### Compiling and Deploying Contracts

1. Compile your contract by running the following command:
   ```
   starknet contract compile contract.cairo --output compiled_contract.json
   ```
2. Deploy your contract to the Sharingan Testnet using the following command:
   ```
   starknet deploy --contract compiled_contract.json --network sharingan
   ```

#### 3.2.2 Using starknet-js

##### Installation and Setup

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) by downloading the installer from the official Node.js website [insert link].
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following commands:
   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
3. Install starknet-js by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install -g starknet
   ```

##### Writing Contracts

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. Write your smart contract code using the StarkNet programming language (Cairo) in a file named `contract.cairo`.

```cairo
[Example contract code]
```

##### Compiling and Deploying Contracts

1. Compile your contract by running the following command:
   ```
   starknet compile contract.cairo --output compiled_contract.json
   ```
2. Deploy your contract to the Sharingan Testnet using the following command:
   ```
   starknet deploy --contract compiled_contract.json --network sharingan
   ```

#### 3.2.3 Using starknet-py

##### Installation and Setup

1. Install Python by downloading the installer from the official Python website [insert link].
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
3. Install starknet-py by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install starknet
   ```

##### Writing Contracts

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. Write your smart contract code using the StarkNet programming language (Cairo) in a file named `contract.cairo`.

```cairo
[Example contract code]
```

##### Compiling and Deploying Contracts

1. Compile your contract by running the following command:
   ```
   starknet contract compile contract.cairo --output compiled_contract.json
   ```
2. Deploy your contract to the Sharingan Testnet using the following command:
   ```
   starknet deploy --contract compiled_contract.json --network sharingan
   ```
